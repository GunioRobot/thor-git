h1. Thor-Git

Here are a few Thor tasks to make developing with Git easier (and some corresponding Git aliases to 
make invoking them easier). Install them with:

<pre>
$ rake install
</pre>

Or, if you don't want to actually download this stuff, just use Thor:

<pre>
$ thor install "http://github.com/cypher/thor-git/tree/master/git.thor?raw=true"
</pre>

h2. Common Commands

<pre>
$ thor git:update
</pre>

Updates your current git repository, autodetecting whether you have a regular ol' git project or a
git-svn project. I recommend aliasing it @git up@.

<pre>
$ thor git:push
</pre>

Commits any changes in your current branch not yet pushed upstream _and_ ports 'em over to master. I use @git ci@ for this one.

<pre>
$ thor git:open [NAME=mynewbranch]
</pre>

Creates a new branch off master. Think of this as opening an issue, or a new path of development. I use @git open@ for this one, allowing you to call it like so:

<pre>
$ git open mynewbranch
</pre>

You can even call it without the branch name and it'll ask you for it:

<pre>
$ git open
* Name your branch: mynewbranch
</pre>

<pre>
$ thor git:close [NAME=mynewbranch]
</pre>

This is open's brother, and should be used when you finish something and have already moved it to
master or upstream. If you haven't yet, don't worry - this won't eat your data. Like open, this one I alias to @git close@.
